Brief Description
    -Self-administered 7 item instrument that uses some of the DSM-V criteria for GAD (General Anxiety
  Disorder) to identify probable cases of GAD along with measuring anxiety symptom severity. It can
  also be used as a screening measure of panic, social anxiety, and PTSD. It was modeled after the
  PHQ9 to be used quickly and effectively within a primary care setting.
    - When considering a diagnosis, the clinician will still need to use clinical interviewing skills to
  determine whether the symptoms are causing clinically significant distress or impairment and
  those symptoms are not better explained or attributed to other conditions (i.e. substance use,
  medical conditions, bereavement, etc.
